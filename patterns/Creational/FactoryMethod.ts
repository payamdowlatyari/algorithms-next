// Also known as: Virtual Constructor, Polymorphic Factory

// Intent: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
// alter the type of objects that will be created. The Factory Method lets a
// class defer instantiation to subclasses.

// Applicability: When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must
// create or when subclasses want to specify the objects they create.

// Structure: The Creator class declares the factory method that is supposed to
// return an object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide
// the implementation of this method. The Product interface declares the
// operations that all concrete products must implement. Concrete Products
// provide various implementations of the Product interface.

// Real-world example: A web page with a form that captures a user's input. When
// the form is submitted, you want to store the user's input in the database.

// ### Pros:
// - You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
// - Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
// - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

// ### Cons:
// - The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern.
// The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
