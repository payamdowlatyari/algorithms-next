// Intent: Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

// Motivation: You can define new operations without changing the classes of the
// elements on which these operations are called.

// Applicability: When you have a hierarchy of objects, and you want to be able
// to add new operations to the hierarchy without modifying the classes of the
// objects.

// Structure: The Visitor interface declares a set of methods that correspond to
// operations defined in the Object structure. These methods declare the set of
// operations available to clients. Each Concrete Visitor implements these
// operations.

// Real-world example: A web page with a form that captures a user's input. When
// the form is submitted, you want to store the user's input in the database.

// ### Pros:
// - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce a new behavior that can work with objects of different classes
// without changing these classes.
// - Single Responsibility Principle. You can move multiple versions of the same behavior into the same class.
// - A visitor object can accumulate some useful information while working with various objects. This might be handy
// when you want to traverse some complex object structure, such as an object tree, and apply the visitor to each
// object of this structure.

// ### Cons:
// - You need to update all visitors each time a class gets added to or removed from the element hierarchy.
// - Visitors might lack the necessary access to the private fields and methods of the elements
// that theyâ€™re supposed to work with.
