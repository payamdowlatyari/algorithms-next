// Also known as: Action, Transaction

// Intent: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
// clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
// undoable operations.

// Applicability: When you want to parameterize an action or a set of actions
// to different objects.

// Structure: The Command interface declares an execute method. Concrete
// commands implement this method by executing the command.

// Real world example: A web page with a form that captures a user's input. When
// the form is submitted, you want to store the user's input in the database.

// ### Pros:
// - Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes
// that perform these operations.
// - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new commands into the app without breaking existing client code.
// - You can implement undo/redo.
// - You can implement deferred execution of operations.
// - You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one.

// ### Cons:
// -  The code may become more complicated since youâ€™re introducing a whole new layer between senders and receivers.
