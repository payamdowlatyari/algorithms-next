// Also known as: Wrapper, Translator

// Intent: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
// Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

// Applicability: When you want to use existing code, but its interface isn't compatible with
// the one you need.

// Structure: The Adapter class implements the Target's interface using the Adaptee's interface.
// It delegates the client calls to the Adaptee's methods.

// Real-world example: You want to use an existing class, but its interface is incompatible
// with the one you need. You can create an adapter that translates the interface.

// ### Pros:
// - Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.
// - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code,
// as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface.

// ### Cons:
// - The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes.
// Sometimes itâ€™s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.
