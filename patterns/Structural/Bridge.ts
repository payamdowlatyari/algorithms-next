// Intent: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can
// vary independently.

// Applicability: When you have two independent hierarchies of classes, and you
// want to decouple the corresponding interfaces.

// Structure: The Abstraction defines the interface for the "control" part of the
// two class hierarchies. It maintains a reference to an object of the
// Implementation hierarchy and delegates all of the real work to this object.
// The Abstraction doesn't have to know anything about the concrete classes of
// the Implementation hierarchy.

// Real-world example: A web page with a form that captures a user's input. When
// the form is submitted, you want to store the user's input in the database.

// ### Pros:
// - You can create platform-independent classes and apps.
// - The client code works with high-level abstractions. It isnâ€™t exposed to the platform details.
// - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.
// - Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.

// ### Cons:
// - You might make the code more complicated by applying the pattern to a highly cohesive class.
