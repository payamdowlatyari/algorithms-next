// Example 1:

// Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
// And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
// You need to output 1.

// Example 2:

// Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
// You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
// You need to output 2.
